            <h3>Sources</h3>
            <p>The movie dataset I used came from a website for a data visualization course at the University of Washington. It is found <a href="https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse512/16sp/a2.html
">here</a>. </p>        
            <p>It should be noted that the methods for selecting which movies are included in the dataset arenâ€™t stated, despite the large sample. The dataset's sources and creators are also unknown.</p>

            <h3>Method</h3>
            <p>The dataset is narrowed down to those entries that had listed source material, release dates, IMDb ratings, and genres. While ratings from both Rotten Tomatoes and IMDb were included, I chose the latter because more people gave ratings. I also limited the movies to those released between 1935 and 2010. </p>
            <p>Then, with Excel, I looked at how films with varying source material were rated, with a particular interested to trends over time and within specific genres. I created the graphics in Illustrator, and created a small website with HTML/CSS/jQuery. </p>
